# mypy_phonebook 

This mypy_phonebook is one of the early tasks I worked on when I started learning python. It is a simple phonebook directory built using python buiilt-in functions only.

If you are new to python, you'll find this notebook useful. 

I'll be glad to assist if you have any issues :-)
